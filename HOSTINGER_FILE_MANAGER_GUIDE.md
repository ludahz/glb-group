# 🚀 Hostinger File Manager Deployment Guide

## ✅ Static Export Ready!

Your Next.js project has been successfully converted to a static website. The `out/` folder (9.0MB) contains everything needed for hosting.

## 📁 What to Upload

**Upload the contents of the `out/` folder to your Hostinger File Manager:**

```
out/
├── index.html                 # Homepage
├── 404.html                   # Error page
├── _next/                     # Next.js assets
├── images/                    # Your images
├── favicon.ico                # Site icon
├── robots.txt                 # SEO file
├── about/                     # About pages
├── contact/                   # Contact pages
├── products/                  # Product pages

## 🔧 Hostinger File Manager Steps

### Step 1: Access File Manager
1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to **Files** → **File Manager**
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. **Delete default files** in `public_html` (index.html, etc.)
2. **Upload method options**:
   - **Option A**: Zip the `out/` folder contents and upload/extract
   - **Option B**: Upload files directly (slower but reliable)

### Step 3: Upload Process
```bash
# On your computer, zip the contents:
cd out/
zip -r website.zip *

# Then upload website.zip to public_html and extract
```

### Step 4: Set Permissions
- Ensure all files have correct permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
- This is usually automatic in Hostinger

## 🌐 Domain Configuration

### After Upload:
1. **Test your site**: Visit your domain (may take 5-10 minutes to propagate)
2. **Update robots.txt**: Edit `robots.txt` with your actual domain
3. **Test all pages**: Navigate through your site to ensure everything works

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Static Hosting

### EmailJS Configuration:
- Your contact forms will work with EmailJS
- Make sure your EmailJS service is properly configured
- Environment variables are embedded during build (already done)

### Current Configuration:
```javascript
// These values are already built into your static files:
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID: "your_new_service_id_here"
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID: "template_rq9v4bc"
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY: "user_N1BOgYgW3cDmEJxoe3AZ2"
```
